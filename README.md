# KnightQuest

KnightQuest is an interactive 2D grid-based game where the player navigates a maze, collects keys, and avoids guards to reach the exit door and win. The game is built using **Python** and **Pygame Zero**.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Maze Generation**: A randomly generated map with walls, keys, and guards to create a challenging environment.
- **Player and Guard Movements**: Guards move toward the player, adding an element of strategy and difficulty.
- **Win and Lose Conditions**: The player wins by collecting all keys and reaching the door; losing occurs if caught by a guard.
- **Random Background Generation**: Randomly generated cracks on the floor give a unique look to each playthrough.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install **Pygame Zero** with the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pgzero
